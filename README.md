# smyths_bot
A simple Python script that uses Selenium to monitor a product. Once the item comes back in stock, the bot will attempt to add it to cart and checkout the basket.
However, the user would have to manually select the expiry month and year at the final stage of the checkout process and hit 'Place Order' button at the bottom of the page.
